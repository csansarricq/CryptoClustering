# CryptoClustering
This challenge demonstrates working knowledge using Pythonâ€™s unsupervised learning libraries to predict how cryptocurrencies are affected by 24- hour or 7-day price changes. Overall general steps include:
1.	Create a scaled data frame.
2.	Utilize the elbow method algorithm to visualize and find the best value for k from a range of 1-11.
3.	Fit the K-means model to the scaled data frame.
4.	Predict the clusters for the cryptocurrencies.
5.	Create scatter plots with the original data.
6.	Utilize the PCA analysis to create three components to calculate the total explained variance.
7.	Create a data frame from PCA data and fit it to a K-means model.
8.	Compare the elbow and cluster scatter data plot from the original scaled data frame with the PCA data frame.
